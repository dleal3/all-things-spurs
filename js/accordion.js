              <p className="blogpost"> After the Kawhi Leonard and Spurs lost game 4 to Mike Conley and the Grizzlies, I had to do something I’ve never done before. I had to explain a loss to a 5 year old. Although she’s watched games with me before, this is my daughter’s first real immersion into the emotional crucible of the playoffs. Saturday morning, she had put on the #2 Leonard shirt that she’d gotten before the playoffs started. Then the fourth quarter and overtime came and she watched her hero play like the Kobe-LeBron hybrid he’s been all season. She was ecstatic, even if her father knew what was probably coming.

After Marc Gasol won the game with an off-balance jumper, she reacted the way we all do when we’re faced with the perceived injustice of the universe.

So I, grizzled veteran in his third decade of watching the Spurs in the playoffs, had to reassure her that the Spurs still had two more games at home with an excellent chance of winning the series. This was necessary, because the Spurs were allegedly - in her words - “dead”. The Grizzlies had killed them.

I explained to her that even though they had lost, we could take encouragement from the fact that they fought back from a 10 point fourth quarter deficit, that we still had the best player in the series, and that the Grizzlies had only done what they were supposed to do.

Was I bluffing a little? I’m still not sure. There’s a reason no one wanted to play Memphis. They’re like Arnold’s T-1000 in Terminator 2: they never stop coming, even when they’re severely overmatched against a superior force. They have pesky young guys, like James Ennis and Andrew Harrison, whose heroics will go overlooked in light of Marc Gasol’s and Mike Conley’s big shots. They have even peskier veterans like Zach Randolph and Vince Carter, who is embarassing his fellow NBA oldster Manu Ginobili in this series (I withheld from my kid that Manu is shooting 0-15 in the first four games because I don’t want her to start having nightmares.) And in Gasol and Conley, Memphis has a pair of stars who are easy to overlook until they’re sending you home with your tail between your legs.

But they aren’t superstars. Only the Spurs have one of those. After dominating the Grizz defense for ten quarters in games 1-3, Kawhi Leonard accelerated his ascent to a higher plane of basketball consciousness in game 4. With 43 points, he shattered the playoff career scoring high that he set just a few nights earlier in game 2. (That total, by the way, is exceeded in Spurs playoff history only by The Iceman.) And the way Kawhi did his thing, by accounting for nearly all of his team’s scoring in the fourth quarter and overtime, was eerily reminiscent of LeBron’s performance against Detroit in the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals when he scored 26 of his team’s final 27 points.

But those LeBron teams never won a championship, and advanced to only one Finals. If you’re on this site, there’s a good chance you remember that one because it ended in a Spurs sweep. The 2007 Spurs won that year because everyone in the rotation made contributions while Cleveland had to rely on a single guiding light to do everything.

Here in 2017, the Grizzlies have guys like Harrison making clutch plays in transition and sinking overtime free throws to keep his team in front. Kawhi outscored Conley and also guarded him on the other end, but Conley had five other teammates in double figures compared to Kawhi’s two.

One of those two was LaMarcus Aldridge, who did most of his offensive damage in the third quarter to finish with 13 points. Aldridge was signed to be the 1B star to Kawhi’s 1A, but this season he’s struggled mightily to find a consistent groove. I’m not an expert on body language, but he’s played like a guy who doesn’t look comfortable with himself or his team. If the Spurs end this season without a championship, a lot of fingers will point to the guy for whom the Spurs unretired #12.

As for the rest of the current roster, it’s hard to know what to expect from anybody on a nightly basis besides Patty Mills and Danny Green. Tony Parker followed up a 0 point outing in game 3 with a gutty 22 in game 4, but he was repeatedly targeted on defense - including Conley’s tying shot at the end of regulation - and ultimately wasn’t up to the task of being the number two offensive option late in the game.

Mills’ decision to try to finish the fast break layup that Harrison blocked off the backboard was a turning point in overtime. A Spurs’ basket would’ve given SA a two possession game with about 1:30 to go. Instead, Memphis got a Gasol three point play which cut the lead to one. One thing my daughter will learn as she becomes a Spurs fan is that basketball, and playoff games in particular, often come down to a matter of inches. After Patty’s fastbreak try went the other way, those of us of a certain age heard Skee-Lo’s “I Wish I Was a Little Bit Taller”.

Back home, my shorty was wanting to know why her team lost to the “mean” Grizzlies. I had to tell her that sometimes the other team deserves to win more than your team. Then I thought for a moment, and I clarified that while the Spurs might not have deserved to win the game, Kawhi Leonard didn’t deserve to lose. We still have the best player in the series, I assured her. But even the best need help. As the Spurs of the past proved over and over, one superstar can win an individual game and maybe even a series, but ultimately it takes a team to go all the way.</p>

              <p className="blogpost">
              So, the question before us: Why are the 2016-17 Spurs so good?

              The easy answer is to say offense, because it just so happens that the Spurs’ Offensive Rating of 109.9 (per NBA.com’s Stats Index) is the best in franchise history. But offensive efficiency is up across the league, to the point where the Spurs only rank fifth in the NBA. That 109.9 would’ve tied for second last year, and led the league in each of the past two seasons before that. Conversely, their Defensive Rating of 101.6 looks mediocre, it’d have ranked eighth last year and 12th two seasons ago, but this season it’s fourth.

              However, even in a league that’s growing ever more homogenized, with everyone firing away from outside and learning to eschew long twos, the Spurs are still finding a way to stand out. What specifically are they doing well?

              For starters, they’re shooting threes with historic accuracy, nailing 40.7 percent of their attempts. Last season’s Golden State Warriors canned 41.6 percent, Alvin Gentry’s Phoenix Suns of 2009-10 hit 41.2, and our all-time champions, believe it or not, had a Curry on the roster, only it was Stephen’s father Dell on the 1996-97 Charlotte Hornets, who sank an incredible 42.8 percent of their threes as a team.

              What that accuracy means is that while they’re only 21st in attempts, they’re actually 14th in makes, knocking down 18.6 freebies per game. The last time a Spurs team made that many at the charity stripe, you had to go back to the 2004-05 season, with Tim Duncan close to his prime and Ginobili and Parker just entering theirs.

              Their ability to make threes and finish at the rim has the Spurs tied-for-second in overall field goal percentage, despite their love affair for mid-range twos (though they have solid shooters taking the majority of those, too). The team ethos for moving the ball and looking for great shots instead of settling for good ones has enabled the Spurs to be in the top-five in field goal percentage for years. Their last season outside the top-five was 2009-2010 (where they ranked sixth) and you have to go back to 2007-08 for their last finish outside the top-10.

              So what all that efficiency boils down to is this. The Spurs make a couple more buckets per game than their opponents, a .5 more threes per night, and about two-and-a-half more free-throws. Those fractions may seem marginal, just a point here and a point there, but those fractions add up and often make the difference between a win and a loss or a close win and a comfortable one.</p>

              <p className="blogpost"> Remember a few weeks ago when everyone was worried about Kawhi Leonard being frozen out on the defensive end and lethargic offense from basically everyone except Leonard and the bench? Yeah, times have changed. The starters are beginning to look like a cohesive unit that’s been together for more than a couple of months, and the defense has gone from a decent-but-not-championship-caliber unit at the beginning of the season back to the terror the Spurs have always prided themselves on being.

              Sure, the current stretch of schedule isn’t exactly the toughest, but back in November the Spurs were caught taking their opponents for granted and either losing or having to rally back late to beat lesser teams. That is no longer the case, as the Spurs have held a 20 point lead in seven of their last eight games and are leaving no doubt who the better team is. They look like a team that is having fun out there, and that is a very good sign as the second half of the schedule draws near.</p>
